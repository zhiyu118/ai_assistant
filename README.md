# Business Intelligence & AI Assistant on Azure
This repository contains sample code of my work for Goertek Inc. I make sure that all information is compliant with NDA.
You can find a Python script and a Jupyter notebook. The notebook documents the analytic workflow for buisness intelligence (the output and data sources have been ommited). The Python file demonstrates the development of an AI agent on Azure to help with routine tasks within the product marketing team.
